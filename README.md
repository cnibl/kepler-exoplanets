# kepler-exoplanets
Project on exoplanet data from the Kepler telescope. The analysis is contained in the ``src/neural_network.py`` script. When executed, this script trains a neural network on a subset of the Kepler data and validates with the remaining data, with the goal of predicting whether an observed object in the data is an exoplanet candidate or not. 


## Documentation
There is documentation on the dataset and the analysis in the ``docs`` folder.
